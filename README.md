Abstract

Volatility in finance is an important indicator of risk to invest. We explain volatility as the dynamics of aggressive order. To this end, the market order is categorized into four aggressive types such as type Zero, One, A, and B based on the mechanism of the adverse price movement. Type B is the most aggressive order and the institutional traders submit it more than the individual traders. The macro- and micro-level approaches show the relationship between the dynamics of aggressive order and volatility and the impact of aggressive order respectively. The burstiness and memory of type B, especially, has a high correlation with volatility in the macroscopic analysis. Traders submit abruptly the aggressive orders during the crisis, and it is more predictable. In the micro-scale, we study the effect of each order based on the resilience and price impact. Type B has a higher impact than type A, even if the price change of type B is small. The results show the aggressive order has more information about a price due to price impact larger than execution cost.
