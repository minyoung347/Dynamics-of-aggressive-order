Abstract

We investigate the dynamics of the aggressive order in the financial market to further understand volatility. We categorize market order into four types in terms of aggressiveness: types Zero, One, A and B, of which type B is the most aggressive order. Adverse price movement is employed in this categorization. Macrolevel approaches show the dynamics of the aggressive order, while microlevel approaches show the impact. From the macroscopic perspective, the burstiness and memory of type B is highly correlated with volatility. When traders face a financial crisis, they place bursty aggressive orders, and the orders are more predictable than usual. From the microscopic perspective, we additionally focus on the influence of the orders, particularly the price impact and resilience. Type B shows a higher impact than type A, even when the price change of type B is smaller. Moreover, the aggressive order delivers more information on price because the aggressive order has a higher price impact than the execution cost.
